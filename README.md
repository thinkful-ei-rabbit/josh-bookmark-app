Here are the user stories I have answered with my code.

As a user: They should be able to add bookmarks to a bookmark list. Bookmarks should contain the following information:

<ul>
<li>A bookmark title</li>
<li>url link</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>rating (1-5)</li>
</ul>

As a user they should see a list of their bookmarks when they first open the app. In this first view the user should see a "condensed" view, showing only the title of the bookmark alongside a star rating. The user should have the option to "expand" an individual bookmark.

If a user is viewing the expanded view, they should see a description of the website along with a clickable link to the website in addition to the title and rating by stars.

The user should be able to add and delete bookmarks. If the user chooses to add a bookmark they should be displayed a form which allows for the entering of Title, url, description and a rating.

When submitting a new bookmark, the user should receive feedback if something has been entered incorrectly.

The user should also be able to filter their bookmarks by rating. This is done by selecting from a dropdown menu, their desired minimum rating.
